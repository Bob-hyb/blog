Hello there 👋

I am a second year master student in Software Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I work in the [Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS)](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by professor [Rong Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/rong_chen) and assistant professor [Jinyu Gu](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/jinyu_gu). Currently, my major research interests include Operating Systems, TEE and Cloud Computing.

## Education
#### [ Sep 2020 — Mar 2023 (expected) ] Shanghai Jiao Tong University
Master student in software engineering advised by [Rong Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/rong_chen) and [Jinyu Gu](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/jinyu_gu).

#### [ Sep 2016 — Jun 2020 ] Xidian University
B.Eng. in communication engineering advised by [Yang Gao](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/gaoyang/index.html).

## Project
#### [ Sep 2020 — Present ] ChCore: IPADS self-developed Microkernel Operating System
I have been working with a team led by professor [Haibo Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/haibo_chen) and assistant professor [Jinyu Gu](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/jinyu_gu) on the development of ChCore. I mainly worked on the following things:

* Porting ChCore to RISC-V architecture.
* Porting ChCore to x86-64 real machine.
* Enabling PCID/ASID for ChCore in x86-64, AArch64 and RISC-V architectures.
* Implementing an unified page cache layer for user-level file systems.
* Implementing several user-level device drivers.

## Research
Recently, I am working on a new resource isolation mechanism for serverless computing. Related work in this area include Amazon's Firecracker (NSDI'20), Google's gVisor and FAASM (ATC'21), etc. My goal is to design and implement a new resource isolation mechanism that addresses the shortcomings of existing mechanisms.

So far, I have made the following efforts:

* Classifying various existing resource isolation mechanisms and analyzing their advantages and disadvantages from multiple dimensions.
* Identifying the common shortcomings of existing resource isolation mechanisms.
* Exploring the design space of resource isolation mechanisms and looking for potential ways to solve the problem.

## Teaching
#### SJTU CS1501 Programming - Ideas and Methods (for undergraduates)
TA in fall 2021; Worked with assistant professor [Mingkai Dong](https://dong.mk/).

## Recent Awards & Achievements
* IPADS fellowship (Sep 2021)
* IPADS ChCore contribution award (Jun 2021)
* Scored 653 points in CET-6 (Dec 2019) (Often teased by my friends because of this 🤣)
