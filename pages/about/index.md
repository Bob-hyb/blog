Hello there 👋

I am a second year master student in Software Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I work in the [Institute of Parallel and Distributed Systems (IPADS)](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by professor [Rong Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/rong_chen) and assistant professor [Jinyu Gu](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/jinyu_gu). My major research interests include Microkernel operating system and serverless computing.

## Education
#### [ Sep 2020 — Mar 2023 (expected) ] Shanghai Jiao Tong University
Master student in software engineering advised by [Rong Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/rong_chen) and [Jinyu Gu](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/jinyu_gu).

#### [ Sep 2016 — Jun 2020 ] Xidian University
B.Eng. in communication engineering advised by [Yang Gao](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/gaoyang/index.html).

## Project
#### [ Sep 2020 — Present ] ChCore: IPADS self-developed Microkernel Operating System
I have been working with a team led by professor [Haibo Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/haibo_chen) and assistant professor [Jinyu Gu](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/jinyu_gu) on the development of ChCore. I mainly worked on the following things:

* Porting ChCore to RISC-V architecture.
* Porting ChCore to x86-64 real machine.
* Enabling PCID/ASID in x86-64, AArch64 and RISC-V architecture.
* Implementing page cache for user-level FileSystem service.
* Implementing several user-level device drivers.

## Research
Since Feb 2022, I have been working on a new resource isolation technology for serverless computing. Related work in this area include Amazon's Firecracker (NSDI 20), Google's gVisor and FAASM (ATC 21), etc. My goal is to design and implement a new resource isolation technology that addresses the shortcomings of existing technologies.

## Teaching
#### CS1501 Programming - Ideas and Methods (for undergraduates)
TA in fall 2021; Worked with assistant professor [Mingkai Dong](https://dong.mk/).

## Recent Honor
* IPADS Class C scholarship  [ Mar 2021 ]
