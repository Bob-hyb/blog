Hello there 👋

I am a second year master student in Software Engineering at Shanghai JiaoTong University. I work in the Institute of Parallel And Distributed Systems (IPADS), advised by professor [Rong Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/rong_chen) and assistant professor [Jinyu Gu](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/jinyu_gu). My major research interests include Microkernel operating system and serverless computing.

## Education
#### [ Sep 2020 — Mar 2023 (expected) ] Shanghai Jiao Tong University
Master student in software engineering advised by [Rong Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/rong_chen) and [Jinyu Gu](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/jinyu_gu).

#### [ Sep 2016 — Jun 2020 ] Xidian University
B.E. in communication engineering advised by [Yang Gao](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/gaoyang/index.html).

## Project
#### [ Sep 2020 — Present ] ChCore: IPADS self-developed Microkernel Operating System
There is a group of people in our lab working on the development of ChCore, and I am one of them. I mainly worked on the following things:

* Porting ChCore to RISC-V architecture.
* Porting ChCore to x86-64 real machine.
* Enabling PCID/ASID in x86-64, AArch64 and RISC-V architecture.
* Implementing page cache for user-level FileSystem service.
* Implementing several user-level device drivers.

## Research
Since Feb 2022, I have been working on a new resource isolation technology for serverless computing. Related works in this area include Amazon's Firecracker (NSDI 20), Google's gVisor and FAASM (ATC 21), etc. Designing and implementing a new resource isolation technology that addresses the shortcomings of existing technologies is my goal.

## Teaching
#### CS1501 Programming - Ideas and Methods (for undergraduates)
TA in fall 2021; Worked with assistant professor [Mingkai Dong](https://dong.mk/).

## Recent Honor
* IPADS Class C scholarship  [ Mar 2021 ]
